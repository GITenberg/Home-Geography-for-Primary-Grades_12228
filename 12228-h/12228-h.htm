<div class="preface">
<p>Geography may be divided into the geography of
the home and the geography of the world at large. A knowledge of
the home must be obtained by direct observation; of the rest of the
world, through the imagination assisted by information. Ideas
acquired by direct observation form a basis for imagining those
things which are distant and unknown.
</p><p>
The first work, then, in geographical instruction, is to study that
small part of the earth's surface lying just at our doors. All
around are illustrations of lake and river, upland and lowland,
slope and valley. These forms must be actually observed by the
pupil, mental pictures obtained, in order that he may be enabled to
build up in his mind other mental pictures of similar unseen forms.
The hill that he climbs each day may, by an appeal to his
imagination, represent to him the lofty Andes or the Alps. From the
meadow, or the bit of level land near the door, may be developed a
notion of plain and prairie. The little stream that flows past the
schoolhouse door, or even one formed by the sudden shower, may
speak to him of the Mississippi, the Amazon, or the Rhine.
Similarly, the idea of sea or ocean may be deduced from that of
pond or lake. Thus, after the pupil has acquired elementary ideas
by actual perception, the imagination can use them in constructing,
on a larger scale, mental pictures of similar objects outside the
bounds of his own experience and observation.
</p><p>
To effect this, the teacher should visit with her class places
where the simpler geographical features in miniature may be
observed. If the school is in the city, pupils may be taken to the
parks for this purpose. If out-of-door study be impossible, they
may be induced to recall objects which they have seen on their way
to school or on short excursions in the neighborhood. In the case
of children who have little opportunity for observing nature, a
drawing, a photograph, or a model will be helpful in giving them a
proper idea of the matter. It must not be forgotten, however, that
actual observation by the pupil is necessary to seeing clearly and
intelligently.
</p><p>
Vegetable and animal life are essential features of the geography
of the world, and considerable time should be given to the study of
those within the observation of the pupils. Information concerning
plants may be gained by outdoor study; also by planting seeds in
boxes and having pupils carefully watch their germination and
growth.
</p><p>
Pupils should be encouraged to make collections of the minerals and
rocks of their region. These should be classified and arranged for
use, not for show.
</p><p>
The lessons about rain, snow, dew, etc., should be given at
appropriate times. A wet day will suggest a lesson on rain, a snowy
day a lesson about snow. No attempt should be made at "science"
teaching, so-called. All that should be sought is to get the pupil
thoughtfully to observe, and thus to awaken his interest in the
world about him.
</p><p>
Lessons should be conversational in form, which is always a most
pleasing style for children, as it is the most natural. The work of
the teacher is to awaken and stimulate interest, not to impart
information. The attention of the child should be directed to what
lies around him. He must observe, and think, and express his
thoughts. Nor should his observations be confined to the school and
school hours. He should be encouraged to obtain his information by
his own searching, without guidance, and report the results.
</p><p>
The development of clear mental pictures is stimulated by
expression. "Expression is the test of the pupil's knowledge."
Hence, the child should be required to reproduce what he has
learned. He may do this by modeling, drawing, and oral and written
description. These are placed in the order which should be followed
in the training of children.
</p><p>
The inclination of nearly every child left to his own mode of
development is to make, in some plastic material, what he has seen.
Trying to fashion the hills and valleys with which he is familiar
excites his interest, and leads to closer observation. This may be
followed by the reproduction in molder's sand, or in clay, of the
forms seen in pictures or learned from description. Definitions of
the various forms, hill, mountain, valley, island, etc., should be
developed as they are molded. The memorizing of definitions should
seldom be required, and should never be made a test of the pupil's
knowledge.
</p><p>
Reproduction by the hand should be followed by drawing, whenever
this can be done. Drawing teaches the child how to see well. It
often enables him to reveal what could not well be expressed in
words. He also becomes ready and rapid in the use of the pencil
when he has ideas to put on paper. Only reasonable accuracy should
be required. Practice in making fine pictures should not be the end
sought, but the development of geographical ideas.
</p><p>
Finally, pupils should be led to give clear and connected
statements of what has been learned. For a language lesson, a
written description may be prepared, illustrated by a
drawing.

Lay your hands upon your desk, side by side.

Which side shall we call the right side? The left side?
</p><p>
Put your hands on the middle of your desk on the side farthest from
you. That part is the back of your desk.
</p><p>
Think which is the front of your desk. Put your hands on the front
of your desk.
</p><p>
Who sits on your right hand? On your left? At the desk in front of
you? At the desk behind you?
</p><p>
Turn round. Who is on your right now? On your left? Before you?
Behind you?
</p><p>
Turn again. Who is now on your right? On your left? Before you?
Behind you?

<b>NOTE.--</b>Lead children to see that the terms <i>right, left,
front</i>, and <i>back</i> are of little use in telling the
position of places, and that some fixed standard of direction is
necessary.

<p>
If I should ask, "Which is the way to your home?" who could tell me
what I mean?
</p><p>
You all know which way you must go to find your home, but if you
should wish to go to a place where you have never been, you would
ask, perhaps, "Which way is it?"

<p>
The way to a place is called <i>direction</i>. In order to find a
place, we must know in what direction from us it lies, and we have
names for directions, such as <i>north</i>, <i>south</i>,
<i>east</i>, and <i>west</i>. We may know these directions by
seeing where the sun is.
</p><p>
Did you ever see the sun rise? Point to the place where you saw the
sun rise. The direction in which the sun seems to rise is called
the <i>east</i>.
</p><p>
Did you ever see the sun set? Point to where you saw the sun set.
The direction in which the sun seems to set is called the
<i>west</i>. The west is just the opposite direction from
east.
</p><p>
When do we see the sun rise? Where do we see the sun rise? What is
the name of this direction? When do we see the sun set? Where do we
see it set? What is the name of this direction? On which side of
the schoolroom does the sun rise? On which side does it set? Which
is the east side of your desk? Which the west side?
</p><p>
When coming to school this morning, in what direction did you see
the sun? If we walk so that the morning sun shines in our faces, in
what direction are we going? What direction is behind us?
</p><p>
Now that you know the east, you will be able to find other
directions in this way: Stretch out your arms so that your right
hand points toward the east, and your left hand toward the west.
You are now facing the <i>north</i>. The direction behind you is
the <i>south</i>.

You have learned how to tell north, south, east, and west by the
sun; but how can we tell these directions at night?
</p><p>
Ask some one to point out to you a group of seven bright stars in
the north part of the sky. Some people think that this group of
stars looks like a wagon and three horses; others say that it looks
like a plow.
</p><p>
The proper name of the group containing these seven stars is the
Great Bear. The group was given this name because men at first
thought it looked like a bear with a long tail.
</p><p>
These seven stars are called the Dipper. It is a part of a larger
group called the Great Bear. Find the two bright twinkling stars
farthest from its handle. A line drawn through them will point to
another star, not quite so bright, called the North Star. That star
is always in the north; so by it, on a clear night, you can tell
the other directions at once.
</p><p>
<i>Write on your slates</i>:
</p>
<p>
Sailors out on the sea at night often find direction by looking at
the North Star.</p>

Have you ever seen a compass? It is a box in which is a little
needle swinging on the top of a pin. When this needle is at rest,
one end of it <i>points to the north</i>.
</p><p>
As the needle shows where the north is; it is easy to find the
south, the east, or the west.
</p><p>
With the compass as a guide, the sailor, in the darkest night, can
tell in what direction he is going.
</p><p>
North, south, east, and west are called the <i>chief points</i> of
the compass.

<div class="chaphead">HOW TO TELL DISTANCE.</div>

<p>
To tell where a place is, we must know its direction. But this is
not all; we must also know how far it is from us; that is; its
<i>distance</i>. To find this out we measure.
</p><p>
You have often heard of an <i>inch</i>, a <i>foot</i>, and a
<i>yard</i>. This line is one inch long:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/inch.gif" alt="AN INCH" width=
"72" border="0" /></div>
<p>
Your ruler is twelve inches long, that is a foot. Three lengths of
your ruler make a yard. A yard stick is three feet long.</p>

<p>
With these measures you can tell how long your slate or your desk
is, or how long and wide the schoolroom is.
</p><p>
The inch, foot, and yard are used for measuring short distances.
But when we wish to tell the distance between objects far apart, we
use another measure called a <i>mile</i>. A mile is much longer
than a yard.
</p><p>
Think of some object that is a mile from our schoolhouse. How long
would it take you to walk that distance?

<b>ORAL EXERCISES.</b>
</p><p>
How many inches long is your slate? How long is your desk? How many
feet long is your room? How wide is it? What is the distance around
the room? How many feet wide is each window? Each door? How many
yards wide is the nearest street or road?
</p><p>
About what is the height of the schoolroom? Of the schoolhouse? Of
the tallest tree near by? Of the nearest church spire?
</p><p>
About how long is the longest street in the town where you live? Do
you know how many blocks or squares make a mile? Name the nearest
river or creek. Give its direction from the school. In what
direction does the water run? Give the direction and distance of
the nearest church. What must you know to go to any place?
</p><p>
<b>NOTE.--</b>Have pupils estimate distances by the eye, then
verify by actual measurement. Continue the exercises until the work
becomes quite accurate. Correct ideas of distance are necessary in
order to understand how large the world is, and how far apart
places are on its surface.

You all know what a picture is. But do you know what a plan
is?
</p><p>
A little boy wanted to show his cousin, who lived some miles away;
the shape and size of his house, and how the rooms were arranged.
How could he do this?
</p><p>
On a large sheet of white paper, he placed lines of blocks in the
form of his house. Then, with a lead pencil, he drew a line on the
paper along the sides of the blocks. He next took up the blocks,
and there, on the paper, was a plan of his house.

Here is a picture of a schoolroom. We see desks, the teacher's
table, a chair, a clock, globe, and two maps, in the picture. The
picture shows these objects as they would appear if we stood at the
door behind the teacher's table and looked in.
</p><p>
This is a plan of the schoolroom, a picture of which is shown
above. You see, the plan and picture are quite different.
</p>

</table>

<p>
The picture shows the objects as we see them before us. The plan
shows where the objects are, and their direction from one
another.
</p><p>
Now let us see if we can make a plan of the same schoolroom on the
blackboard.
</p><p>
The first thing is to measure the sides of the room. We will
suppose the two long sides are each forty feet long, and the two
short sides each thirty feet long. Now we will draw four straight
lines on the board for the four sides. Of course, the lines must be
much shorter than the sides themselves, else our plan will be too
large.
</p><p>
Make one inch in the plan stand for one foot in the room. So the
lines for the long sides will each be forty inches long, and the
lines for the short sides thirty inches long.
</p><p>
The next thing is to make spaces in the sides for the door and the
windows, and oblongs for the desks. But we must remember that an
inch in our plan stands for a foot in the object itself, and
therefore we must allow as many inches for the width of doors and
windows, and for the length and width of the desks, as there are
feet in the objects themselves. Thus, if the door is three feet
wide, we must make it three inches wide in our plan.
</p><p>
And lastly, we will draw a circle for the globe, and an oblong and
square for the teacher's table and chair, that shall show just
where and just how long these objects are.
</p><p>
We have now a <i>plan</i> of the schoolroom. Let us put N. to show
the north side of the room, S. to show the south side, E. to show
the east side, and W. to show the west side. We can now tell the
direction of one thing from another in our plan.

<b>EXERCISES IN DRAWING PLANS.</b>
</p><p>
Draw a plan of the schoolroom on your slates. It cannot be drawn on
your slates as large as it was drawn on the board. So let one inch
stand for ten feet, instead of for one foot; that is, use a
<i>scale</i> of one inch for every ten feet. Your plan will not be
as large as mine, but it will show the position of everything as
correctly.
</p><p>
Draw a plan of the top of the teacher's table, showing two books
and an inkstand upon it. First, measure the sides. Then decide to
what scale you will draw your plan.
</p><p>
Now draw a plan of the schoolhouse and grounds. You must measure
not only the house, but the width and length of the yard. The plan
must show the size, shape, and place of everything upon the
grounds. (While drawing a plan of this kind, it is better to let
the pupils face the north. The top of the plan should be the north
side of the grounds.)
</p><p>
Draw a plan of your own room at home, showing the table, bed,
chairs, and other objects in it.
</p><p>
<b>ORAL EXERCISE.</b>

Mention some things of which plans can be drawn.

<p>
The floor of our schoolroom is level. The playground is almost, if
not quite, level. As you look away from the school, is the land
nearly level? Did you ever see a broad extent of nearly level
land?
</p><p>
Let us imagine that we are out on a piece of nearly level land,
many, many times larger than our playground. Such a broad, nearly
level stretch of land is called a <i>plain</i>.
</p>

If this plain were covered with rich green grass and beautiful
flowers, we should call it a <i>prairie</i>. In the summer it is a
vast sea of waving grass. On the prairie we might find herds of
wild horses and cattle, which feed upon the rich grass. If it were
late in the summer, when the grass is dry and crisp, it might catch
fire, and we might then see a grand sight--a prairie on fire.
</p><p>
We now come to another plain, miles and miles long, miles and miles
wide. No rain falls here, and therefore we see no grass, nor
flowers, nor cattle, nor horses, nothing but dry, burning sand,
rocks, or gravel. We are in a <i>desert</i>. But we are so thirsty
and tired!
</p><p>
No water to drink, no shade from the burning sun! Suddenly, in the
midst of the desert, we come to a beautiful grassy spot. There is a
cluster of date-palm trees, and, better still, a well or a spring
of fresh water. This pleasant spot in the desert is called an
<i>oasis</i>. Here we may quench our thirst, and rest beneath the
shade of the trees.

<p>An <i>oasis</i> is a fertile spot in a desert. What does
<i>fertile</i> mean? When do we say land is fertile? When barren?
When desert?
</p><p>
Find a picture of a palm tree, and try to draw it.
</p><p>
If we were really in a desert, we might see a company of merchants
carrying goods to sell in the countries they visit. Such a company
is called a <i>caravan</i>. The goods are packed in bundles, which
are carried on camels' backs. The camel can live for a long time
without drinking, and can carry a heavy load of merchandise a long
distance. It is sometimes called the ship of the desert.
</p><p>
Why do travelers use camels to cross the desert? Why do they not
use horses? If you can not find answers to these questions in your
books at home, ask your teacher about them.
</p><p>
You have seen a small whirlwind in the street. The leaves flew
round and round, the dust whirled along in clouds. Trees are
sometimes torn from the ground, and houses overturned, by a strong
wind.
</p><p>
Now think of a wind-storm in the desert. A loud, rustling noise is
heard. Great clouds of fine sand are lifted into the air--clouds
which darken the sun! Travelers must at once jump from their
camels, cover themselves with their cloaks, and lie flat on the
ground.
</p><p>
The poor beasts will close their eyes and nostrils, and kneel with
their backs to the wind until the storm has passed over.
</p><p>
Thankful will the travelers be if none of them are buried in the
sand.</p>

What can you see from the top of the hill--meadow, river, lake,
town? What grow on the hill? What live on the hill?
</p><p>
Which part of a hill is called the base, or foot? The slope, or
sides? The top, or summit?
</p><p>
Give two names for the lowest part of a hill. Two for the highest
part. Two for the part between the highest and lowest parts.
</p><p>
Parts of the land very much higher than the surrounding country are
called <i>mountains</i>. Mountains are much higher than hills. Have
you ever seen a steeple one hundred feet high? A mountain is as
high as twenty such steeples, one on the top of the other. How high
the mountains must be!
</p><p>
Some mountains reach away above the clouds. Their white tops seem
to touch the sky. A man on the summit of one saw the clouds beneath
his feet, while the sun shone where he stood. When it lightened he
saw the flash far below him.
</p><p>
Is it warm or cold at the tops of mountains? With what are many
high mountains covered, even in summer?
</p><p>
The land between mountains or hills is called a <i>valley</i>. Is
there a valley near here? What do you call the ground on either
side?
</p><p>
Would you like best to live on the mountains or in the valley?
Why?
</p><p>
Are mountains of any use?
</p><p>
Yes, hills and mountains are of very great use. They make the earth
more beautiful. Tops of high mountains are so cold that they turn
the clouds into drops of water which fall as rain or snow. Then
mountains give rise to rivers which make the valleys beautiful with
grass and flowers. Mountains do much good to some countries by
keeping off cold winds. They also give us coal and iron and other
minerals which we find so useful.

What happens when a kettle of water is put on a hot stove?
</p><p>
The water gets hot and boils away.
</p><p>
Where does it go? Is it destroyed?
</p><p>
The water is changed, but it is not destroyed. Coal burns, but we
do not get rid of it altogether. It is changed into gas and smoke
and ashes.
</p><p>
What is the water changed into?
</p><p>
It is changed to vapor. If we let the kettle remain on the fire
long enough, the water it contains will all pass away as
vapor.
</p><p>
Where does the vapor go? The water, though turned into vapor, must
be somewhere.
</p><p>
It is floating about in the air of the room, though we cannot see
it. The air holds the vapor, just as a sponge holds water.
</p><p>
Heat expands or swells air. Warm air, therefore, can contain more
vapor than cold air. On a warm day there may be many times as much
moisture in the air as on a cold day.
</p><p>
Moisten your slate with a damp sponge. Observe the disappearance of
the moisture.

</p><p>
Sometimes we see leaves and grass sparkle with water-drops, early
in the morning, When the sun shines out and warms the air; what
happens?
</p><p>
Why does vapor rise into the air?

Why does smoke go up? Because it is lighter than air. As vapor is

Now let us think of the kettle with the boiling water. You will
notice a little space; quite close to the spout, where nothing can
be seen. Is there no vapor there?
</p><p>
Yes, there is vapor there, but it cannot be seen; it is invisible.
A little way from the spout we see something white, like smoke.
This is only the vapor that has been chilled by the cool air and
changed back again into water. The water is in the form of very
fine particles, and may be called water-dust.
</p><p>
Hold a cold plate over boiling water. Observe how the water-dust
gathers into drops that roll down the plate.
</p><p>
You have seen the inside of windows in cold weather covered with
moisture. Where does it come from? Why did it form there? Why does
it sometimes run down on the cold pane?

Explain this.

place. A thin mist at once gathers on the outside of the pitcher.
What takes place among the little drops of mist? What becomes of
these larger drops?
</p><p>
Where does the water which collects on the outside of the pitcher
come from? Does it come through the pitcher from the inside? Would

<p>
The sun is all the time heating the water on the land and in the
sea, and changing it into vapor, which rises in the air. We cannot
see the vapor; but it is in the air around us.
</p><p>
If the vapor in the air is suddenly cooled, a strange thing
happens. Some of it quickly changes back into water. You have often
seen, in the early morning, little drops of water hanging like
pearls upon the blades of grass.
</p><p>
Now, where do these drops come from? They come from the air. The
vapor in the air floats against the cold grass and leaves, and is
cooled and changed into tiny drops of water. We call this
<i>dew</i>.
</p><p>
Of what use is dew?
</p><p>
If the night is quite cold, the dew will freeze. It is then called
frost. You have seen the frosty window pane with the beautiful
pictures upon it.
</p><p>
Make a picture of the window as you remember it, covered with the
pretty things made by the frost.

When vapor rises high in the cool air it is turned into very small
drops of water or minute crystals of ice, and we can see it
floating about in the air. It is then called a <i>cloud</i>. Almost
any clear day you may see clouds form and then seem to melt
away.
</p><p>
You have seen on a blue sky, light, fleecy feather-clouds. They are
very high up, and it is very cold where they are. You have also
noticed the clouds at sunset with their beautiful colors. As the
sun sank lower and lower, how did they change, in shape and
color?
</p><p>
When clouds are low down, near the earth, we call them <i>fogs</i>
or <i>mist</i>.
</p><p>
If clouds are cooled, the little particles of water gather into
large drops and fall as <i>rain</i>. If the drops should freeze in
falling, we would call them <i>hail</i>.
</p><p>
What shape are the raindrops? Of what use is the rain?

this.

<p>
As vapor rises into high, cool air, or is carried with the air in
winds up the sides of mountains, it turns into water again, and
comes falling down as rain.
</p><p>
Now think where the rain that falls on mountains must go. Some of
the water runs off on the surface, down the mountain slope. Some
sinks into the ground, and runs along in little streams below the
surface. It will appear again, bubbling out of the mountain side as
a <i>spring</i>. The spring is the beginning of a river.
</p><p>
Did you ever see a spring? Where was it? Was it shaded by trees?
Where did the water come from? Did you drink from it? Was the water
pure and cold? Where did the water go after leaving the
spring?
</p><p>
From the spring flows a tiny, thread-like stream, so small that we
can easily step across it. This little stream is called a
<i>rill</i>.
</p><p>
Other rills meet this, and form a larger stream, which is called a
<i>brook</i> or <i>creek</i>.
</p><p>
<a href="images/029_l.gif" target="_blank" id="ill29"><img src=

"RIVER FROM ITS SOURCE TO ITS MOUTH." border="0" align=
"left" /></a> As the brook flows on, it is joined by other streams,
until, little by little, it becomes a wide and deep <i>river</i> on
which large boats may float. At last, it finds its way into the
ocean.
</p><p>
Where a river begins is its <i>source</i>. The place where it flows
into another body of water is called its <i>mouth</i>. The land
over which it flows is its <i>bed</i>.
</p><p>
A river has two banks. As we go toward its mouth, the right bank is
on our right hand, and the left bank is on our left.
</p><p>
Do you live near a river? Where does the water come from? In what
direction does it flow? Why does it flow in such direction? Does it
wind about much? Does it flow into the ocean, or into another
river?
</p><p>
Is the water fresh or salt? What grow on its banks? Near which bank
do you live?
</p><p>
Make a picture of a spring, and a brook flowing from it. Draw the
tall grass and plants that grow near it.
</p><p>
Write the names of all the rivers you have seen.
</p><p>
<i>Write the following:</i>
</p><p>
Water flowing out of the ground is called a spring.
</p><p>
From springs flow small streams called rills, brooks, or
creeks.
</p><p>
A large stream of water flowing through the land is called a
river.
</p><p>
A small stream of water flowing into a larger one is called a
tributary.
</p><p>
The source of a river is where it begins. The place where it
empties into another body of water is its mouth.
</p><p>
Every river has two banks--a right-hand bank and a left-hand
bank.</p>

<div class="chaptext" id="l19"><a id="less19"></a>
<div class="lesson">LESSON XIX.</div>
<div class="chaphead">MORE ABOUT RIVERS.</div>

<p>
Let us have another chat about the river. We may fancy that we are
following it in its course to the sea. We shall then learn for
ourselves many things we do not know about rivers.
</p><p>
We will begin our journey at its source. Here it is a little rill,
formed by water that trickles from a spring, or by the melting of
snow.
</p><p>
As it flows on, it is joined by many other little streams, until it
grows to be much larger.
</p><p>
There is a large word used for a stream that feeds another stream.
Do you know what it is? The word, is <i>tributary</i>. Tributaries
are often called <i>branches</i>.
</p><p>
Before we leave this part of the river, I wish you to learn another
hard word.
</p><p>
You have seen the water run off the roof of a <i>shed</i>. The
ridge; or highest part of the roof, divides the rain that falls on
it, so that part of the rain flows down the one side, and part of
it flows down the other side.

<p>
Now, hills, like the roof of a house, send off streams on both
sides. When it rains, or the snow melts, some of the water goes
down on one side, some on the other. And that is why the hills
which divide or part the waters of streams are called a
<i>water-parting</i> or <i>water-shed</i>.
</p><p>
Let us now go further down the stream.
</p><p>
Here we see it rushing rapidly down a steep slope. Its waters foam
and dash between the great rocks that lie in the stream. Such
places in the river are called <i>rapids</i>. Can you tell why they
are so called?
</p>

The stream flows on. It has now reached a high ledge of rock. Over
this it leaps, making a great foam and noise.
</p><p>
When the water of a river falls over high rocks, it is called a
waterfall or <i>cataract</i>.
</p><p>
You may have seen the Falls of Niagara, the greatest waterfall in
the world.

"YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THE FALLS OF NIAGARA." /></a> The course of our
river is now through a lower country. The valley in which it flows
spreads out, and the stream grows wider and wider. The water moves
slower and slower.
</p><p>
Why is the river swift in some places, and in others slow?
</p><p>
At length it flows through an almost level country. It is here
widest and deepest. Its course is more winding.
</p><p>
Do you know why it is crooked and winding?
</p><p>
Because on the steep hillside the water runs very rapidly, and is
not easily turned aside. Where the ground is nearly level, it runs
slowly, and is easily turned from its course.</p>

<div class="chaphead">WORK OF FLOWING RIVERS.</div>

<p>
Would you like to know more about brooks and rivers--about the work
they do?
</p><p>
Notice what happens when it rains. Little tiny streams are formed,
which chase each other down the slopes. See how they cut away the
loose soil and carry it off. Notice how muddy this loose soil makes
the water. What becomes of this loose soil, or mud?
</p><p>
Fill a jar with water. Put in a handful of mud from the nearest
stream. Shake the jar, and the water is muddy. Let it stand awhile.
What do you notice? The water is clear, and the soil has settled to
the bottom.
</p><p>
Follow the streams to the valley where they unite to form a river.
When does the load of mud it carries settle? Here, where the water
scarcely moves, we find some of the soil spread out over the ground
near the river banks.
</p><p>
You have seen a river overflow its banks. When the water went down,
it left a layer of rich mud, which made the soil very
fertile.

<p>
Have you never seen the low ground on the banks of rivers covered
with rich grass and clover?
</p><p>
Well, these fertile meadows were formed out of the loam that has
been washed down the streams from the far-off hills and
mountains.
</p><p>
Look at the jar again. Which settled first, the coarse material or
fine loam? What kind of a deposit will be made in the upper course
of a river? What kind toward the mouth?
</p><p>
High up in the valley, when the river is low, we see <i>pebbles</i>
in its bed; lower down, the pebbles are worn into <i>gravel;</i>
and as we get still farther down, we find the gravel ground into
<i>sand</i>.
</p><p>
Examine the stones found along the shore of a brook or river. Some
are quite smooth and round. They were not always so, but had sharp
edges. Do you know what made them round?
</p><p>
When there are heavy rains, the rushing water sweeps large stones
down the mountain side and into the valley. As they are carried
down the stream, the stones, by rubbing against each other, are
smoothed and rounded and ground into pebbles. The pebbles
themselves are ground at last into gravel and fine sand.
</p><p>
This is what the streams are doing everywhere--plowing deep furrows
in the sides of the mountains, grinding the pebbles and sand into
fine soil, and carrying it into the valleys below.</p>

could only get away from the other drops, how much cooler I should
be!' Then each tiny drop separated from the others, and grew so
small you could not see it.
</p><p>
"We, of course, grew lighter, lighter than the air. Up, up we rose
into the bright blue sky. When we got pretty high, where the air
was cool, we came closer together again and formed a great fleecy
white <i>cloud</i>, that cast its shadow over everything. Then a
friendly wind carried us along, and soon we left the sea behind.
Far below; we could see green fields and waving woods."

to blow. How we shivered with the cold! Then we huddled close
together to get warm. We were now heavy again--so heavy that we

<p>
A drawing made to show a room, or a house; or the school-yard, or
even a village, is called a plan.
</p><p>
<a href="images/042_l.gif" target="_blank" id="ill42"><img src=
"images/042.jpg" alt="A MAP" border="0" align="left" /></a>
Drawings which represent land and water are called maps. You may
learn from maps where the countries, and mountains, and rivers, and
cities are that you have seen. It also shows how far places are
from one another.
</p><p>
Here is a map showing mountains and rivers. The many short lines
facing each other represent mountains. To show the very high part
of the mountains, the lines are drawn close to each other, making
that part of the map look dark. The line winding about, like the
stream itself, represents a river. The line, as you see, is made
thicker and thicker toward its mouth. From this you may know that
the river itself becomes broader and broader as it flows toward the
sea.
</p><p>
But you must not think that the crooked line on the map is a river,
or the lines which face each other are mountains. If you do, you
will learn very little of geography. When you look at these lines,
you must <i>think</i> of the real things which they stand for--the
lofty mountains, with their covering of forests, and with long,
narrow valleys between them; the winding, gently flowing river,
bearing boats upon its waters.</p>

<div class="chaphead">FORMS OF LAND AND WATER.</div>

<p>
You all know what a pond is. Is there a pond near where you live?
Did you ever fish in it? Did you ever walk round it?
</p><p>
When a stream, on its way to the ocean, flows into a basin or
hollow in the land, the water spreads out and fills it. A hollow in
the land filled with water is called a <i>lake</i>, or, if it be
quite small, a <i>pond</i>.
</p><p>
What is a lake made of? What is round it? Suppose some one who
never saw a lake were to ask you what a lake is, what would you
say?
</p><p>
What do we find in lakes? Would you not like to sail on a
lake?
</p><p>
In the hollows among mountains are great numbers of beautiful
lakes. In their clear waters may be seen the mountains, the
forests, and the sky, as in a looking-glass. At night the moon and
stars may be seen below you as plainly as above.
</p><p>
Here is a picture of a pretty lake in a valley.
</p><p>
<a href="images/043_l.gif" target="_blank" id="ill43"><img src=
"images/043.2.jpg" alt="A PRETTY LAKE IN A VALLEY." border="0"
align="left" /> <img src="images/043.1.jpg" alt=
"A PRETTY LAKE IN A VALLEY." border="0" align="left" /></a> You see
a river flowing from the hills beyond. Into what is it flowing? The
river that lets the water <i>into</i> the lake is called an
<i>inlet</i>.
</p><p>
You see another river that lets the water <i>out</i> of the lake.
This river we call the <i>outlet</i> of the lake.
</p><p>
Make a lake on your molding-board, or in the sand near your home.
Represent its inlet and outlet.
</p><p>
Out in the lake is a little piece of land round which the waters
play. We could not go to this land without crossing the water; the
water is on all sides of it. Such a little piece of land is called
an <i>island</i>.
</p><p>
Did you ever read the story of Robinson Crusoe? You will remember
that he went up a hill in search of water. When he got to the top
of the hill, he saw that he was on an island. How did he
know?
</p><p>
Have you ever seen an island? What island was it? Could you sail
round it? What was on every side of it? What grew on it? What is an
island?
</p><p>
If there is a brook or lake near your home, how can you make an
island?
</p><p>
Opposite is a picture of a river and a lake. Make a map of the same
river and lake on your slate. Notice how the coast or shore of the
lake bends in and out.
</p><p>
<i>Write the following</i>:
</p><p>
A lake is water surrounded by land.
</p><p>
The land near the water of a lake is called its shore.
</p><p>
An island is a little piece of land surrounded by water.</p>

<p>In the picture we see a narrow strip of land which extends far out
into the water. You will notice that the land has water all round;
except at one place.
</p><p>
What is the name for land that has water on all sides but one? What
is a peninsula? An island, as we have learned, is a piece of land
with water all round it. Now, sometimes we see a piece of land that
has water <i>nearly</i> all round it. This form of land is called a
<i>peninsula</i>. The word peninsula means <i>almost an
island</i>.
</p><p>
<br />
How would you change this peninsula to an island? What is the
difference between a peninsula and an island?
</p><p>
The narrow neck which joins the peninsula to other land--just as
the neck joins the head to the body-is called an <i>isthmus</i>,
which means <i>neck</i>.

Can you think of anything else that is bent like this? Yes-a
bay-window.
</p><p>
Now, when I tell yon that bay means the same as bow, you can almost
guess the name for this bend in the land. It is called a bay. You
will easily remember that little word.
</p><p>
A wide opening or bend in the land, into which the water flows, is
usually called a bay.
</p><p>
Sometimes, when the opening in the bend is long and narrow, it is
called a <i>gulf</i>.

<div class="chaphead">A TRIP TO THE HIGHLANDS.</div>

<p>
Uncle Tom had been telling Fred and me about many strange places he
had seen. Last of all, he told us about some high mountains he had
climbed. We wanted to climb one very much. So father said he would
go with us up a high hill not far from the city.
</p><p>
Mother did not need to call us in the morning, for we woke up very
early. The sky in the east was bright, and we knew that soon we
should see the sun. We wanted to start at once, but mother said it
would be better to have breakfast first.
</p><p>
We put on thick shoes that the stones would not easily cut. Father
gave each of us a stout stick to help us climb. Fred had a
knapsack, in which mother put some bread, cold meat, crackers, and
a cup to drink from. In one corner we put some towels.
</p><p>
We were soon outside the city, walking along the road. We passed a
village, and went through fields and woods. By and by we could see
the land before us rising higher and higher. We saw no longer such
beautiful farms and gardens as we had passed.

<p>In a little while we reached the foot of the hill and began to
ascend. As we went up the slope, we came to steep, rugged places
that were hard to climb, where we needed our sticks. The trees were
smaller, and there were many bushes. There were large rocks, too,
in the sides of the hill. At the foot, the weather was quite warm,
but it grew cooler and cooler the higher we went.

<p>"On the summit at last!" cried Fred, as we reached the top.
</p><p>
From where we stood, we could see the city with its little straight
streets, that look so wide when we walk on them. We could see the
house-tops, too, and the church steeples. Then father showed us the
village we passed; and the woods we went through. But the trees
looked like bushes, and some men at the foot of the hill looked no
larger than the baby.
</p><p>
Down the mountain, a little way, we found a spring where the water
was clear and cool. Here we sat down on a rock, and ate the lunch
we had brought. While we rested, we watched the little rill that
flowed from the spring--</p>
<div class="verse">"Blue in the shadow,<br /> Silver in the sun."</div>
<p>
Down the hill, it was larger, and we saw other rills flowing into
it. When it reached the valley, it was much larger; and farther
down, father said, boats could sail on it.

"Oh, how pretty!" exclaimed I.
</p><p>
"Yes, that is a lake," said father. "How beautiful it looks as the
sunlight plays on its smooth surface! It reflects in its clear
water the sky and the trees around it."
</p><p>
"I can see an island in the lake," said Fred. "Vessels are sailing
all round it."
</p><p>
"Are all islands small, like that?" he asked.
</p><p>
"Oh, no!" said father. "Some islands are hundreds of miles round,
and have many people living upon them."
</p><p>
Fred then pointed to a piece of land extending out into the water,
and asked whether that, too, was an island.
</p><p>
"No," replied father, "that is a peninsula. It is land almost
surrounded by water. And the narrow neck which joins the peninsula
to the mainland is called an isthmus.
</p><p>
"You see the bend in the land, with the water from the lake running
in?" asked father.
</p><p>
"Yes," said Fred.
</p><p>
"That is called a bay. Around every ocean, which is a much larger
body of water, there are many such bays.
</p><p>
"The narrow strip of water, which a boat is just entering, is
called a strait. The strait separates the island from the
mainland."
</p><p>
Stretching far away to the east was flat, level land, which father
called a plain. Scattered here and there were many farmhouses and
quiet villages. Little bright, sparkling streams wound their way
like silver threads through the green grass of the meadows. It was
a lovely scene indeed!

What plant supplies us with much of our clothing? Name articles of
clothing made of cotton.
</p><p>
Did you ever see a field of cotton? In the summer the young plant
is covered with pretty, pale-yellow flowers. In the autumn you see
the pod or boll which contains the cotton.

<p>As the pod ripens, it bursts open. The cotton-field is now a pretty
sight--the bright green leaves, yellow blossoms, and snowy cotton
all mingled together. Form a picture in your mind of a field of
cotton in bloom.
</p><p>
The cotton is now picked. The first thing is to separate it from
its seed. This is done by a machine called a cotton-gin.

There is another plant from which clothing is made.
</p><p>
Do you know what plant linen is made from? Linen comes from the
flax plant.
</p><p>
Flax is a small plant which grows two or three feet high, bearing
on the top a bunch of pretty blue flowers. A field of flax in bloom
is a very pretty sight.
</p><p>
The flax does not grow in a pod like cotton. The stalk of the plant
is covered with a bark, or skin, containing fibers. These fibers
are spun into thread, which is woven into a cloth called
linen.</p>

Do you think the tobacco plant is as useful as the cotton and flax
plants?
</p><p>
Everybody eats sugar. Did you ever see a table set for supper
without a sugar bowl?
</p><p>
The sugar in common use in this country is made chiefly from
sugar-cane. The sugar-cane is a tall plant which looks much like
Indian corn when growing. It is called the sugar-cane because it is
filled with the sweet juice that is made into the sugar.
</p><p>
When the stalks are cut they are taken to a sugar mill. Here they
pass between great rollers which press out the juice. The liquid is
then boiled until it turns to sugar.
</p><p>
Much sugar is made from the sap of the sugar-maple tree. In the
early spring the sap begins to rise. A hole is bored in the tree
and a tube inserted, through which the sap passes to a bucket or
other vessel placed to receive it. The sap is boiled in large
kettles and becomes syrup. More boiling turns the syrup into
sugar.

clean-looking coal, which burns with little blaze, yet gives out
such great heat, is anthracite coal.
</p><p>
Coal has many uses. Mention all you can think of. From which kind
is gas obtained, hard or soft coal?
</p><p>
What is coal? Some day you will be able to understand how coal was
made, and how it got deep down in the earth.
</p><p>
What article used with food is found in mines? Does all <i>salt</i>
come out of the mines? How is the salt made that is not found in
mines?
</p><p>
There are salt mines where men, women, and children live all their
lives, and never see sun or sky. Many great rooms and galleries,
with tall pillars to hold up the roof, are cut out of the salt.
When lighted up with torches, they glitter as if studded with
precious stones. It is like a fairy palace.
</p><p>
Some minerals are called metals. Iron, gold, silver, copper, tin,
and mercury are metals.

<p>Iron is the most useful of all metals. Did you ever think what we
should do without this hard, strong metal? The following lines tell
some of the uses of iron:
</p>
<div class="verse">Iron vessels cross the ocean.<br />
Iron engines give them motion;<br />
Iron pipe our gas delivers,<br />
Iron bridges span our rivers,<br />
Iron horses draw our loads,<br />
Iron rails compose our roads;<br />
Iron houses, iron walls,<br />
Iron cannon, iron balls,<br />
Iron lightning rods on spires,<br />
Iron telegraphic wires,<br />
Iron hammers, nails, and screws,<br />
Iron everything we use.</div>
<p>
Steel is iron made very hard. Knives, axes, hatchets, and other
tools are made of steel. Many little things are made of steel.
Mention some of them.
</p><p>
Which is the most valuable of all metals? Is all the gold made into
money? Is money made of pure gold? Why? Name articles of ornament
made of gold. Articles of use. Are gold watches, chains, and rings
usually made of pure gold? Why? What do you call the man who makes
these articles?

<p>Silver is the whitest and most lustrous of all the metals. What
does "lustrous" mean? Is iron lustrous? Are silver articles usually
made of pure silver? Why?
</p><p>
Silver and gold are found among the mountains in the west.
Sometimes they are dug out of the ground. Sometimes they are found
in rocks, and the rocks must be broken up before they can be taken
out.

<p>Sometimes men wash down the hills with streams of water in order to
get at the silver or gold among the rocks.
</p><p>
Gold and silver are called the <i>precious metals</i> because they
do not rust, and on account of their scarcity.
</p><p>
Tin is white and bright, but too soft to make articles which shall
be light and strong. Therefore, thin plates of iron are dipped into
melted tin. The tin adheres to the iron and makes it bright like
tin itself.
</p><p>
A thin sheet of iron, covered with tin, is called tin-plate. It is
of this that our tin cups, pans, and kitchen utensils are made. A
tin cup is really made of iron.
</p><p>
Lead is a very heavy metal. It is so soft that it can be cut with a
knife. It is used in making shot, and water pipes.
</p><p>
Do you know how shot is made? Did you ever see a shot-tower? Small
shot is made by dropping melted lead through a sieve in rapid
motion, from the top of a high tower. The drops fall into a vessel
of water below. They are next polished and made black, and then are
ready for sale.
</p><p>
You think, I suppose, that the lead pencil with which you write is
made of lead. It is not made of lead, but of graphite, which is a
kind of coal.
</p><p>
Copper is softer than iron, but harder than lead. It will not rust.
Cooking vessels are often made of copper.
</p><p>
Zinc is another valuable metal, and is almost the color of tin.
Brass is made by mixing copper and zinc together.
</p><p>
Mention some articles made of brass.

Write five lines about tin.

Write five or more lines about coal.

<p>
We have seen that there are many kinds of metals. There are also
many kinds of stone. Those which are strong and do not crumble by
exposure are useful for building. The place from which stones are
taken for building is called a <i>quarry.</i>
</p><p>
The more common stones are granite, sandstone; limestone, marble,
and slate.
</p><p>
We will first examine a piece of <i>granite.</i>
</p><p>
How hard and firm it is! What a beautiful clean surface when
polished!
</p><p>
Granite is used for steps, for paving streets, and for sidewalk
curbings. Are houses ever built of granite? Can you think of other
uses of granite?
</p><p>
Why is granite used for these purposes? It is easily shaped. It is
hard enough to give strength. It is enduring. What does "enduring"
mean?
</p><p>
This is a piece of <i>sandstone</i>, made of little grains of sand.
It will crumble more easily than granite. What does "crumble" mean?
Brownstone, used in building, is a kind of sandstone.
</p><p>
And this is the common gray <i>limestone</i> of which lime used in
building is made. The large oven in which lime is burned is called
a lime-kiln. Did you ever see one? Can you tell how the lime is
made?
</p><p>
Here are three pieces of <i>marble</i>. This piece is pure white.
This is colored. It is marked by many strange forms, as you see in
your mantel-pieces and table-tops. In this piece, you see many
colored spots--mottled it may be called.
</p><p>
Marble is beautiful when polished.

<p>In what different ways have you seen marble used? What parts of
furniture are sometimes marble? Why is it suitable for this? Is
marble ever used for building houses? Do you think it would be good
for that purpose? Why? Which, do you think, is the best of all
building stones? Why?
</p><p>
Marble and granite are the most beautiful and enduring of all
building stones.
</p><p>
<i>Chalk</i> is a variety of limestone. Could it be used as a
building stone? Is chalk harder or softer than other stone?
</p><p>
You need not to be told the name of this dark stone. You could not
get along well in school without <i>slate</i>. Slate is easily
split into thin plates, and has a smooth, firm surface.
</p><p>
Slate is used to write on. It is used in house building. What part
of a house is sometimes slate? Think of other uses. Why is it
useful for these purposes?
</p><p>
We must not forget <i>brick</i> in our talks about things that come
out of the ground. Brick is not found in the earth, as the metals
and stone are found; but it is made of clay, which is itself a part
of the ground.
</p><p>
Have you ever seen a brick-yard? What are some of the uses of
bricks? What is the man called who builds houses of bricks?
</p><p>
Is glass taken out of a mine or quarry? No; but glass is made from
sand; which is also a part of the ground.
</p><p>
In laying brick or stone, the mason uses <i>mortar</i>. Mortar is
made chiefly of lime. Lime is made of stone which comes out of the
ground.
</p><p>
If possible, visit mines and quarries. Take careful notice of all
you see, and on your return to school tell what you have
learned.</p>

<p>We could not live without food. We must also have clothes to wear
and houses to live in. Besides these, we need schools, books, and
churches, which make us wiser and better. Now, if you think a
little, you can name many other things which we need to make our
homes beautiful. To supply us with all of these things, men must do
many different kinds of work.
</p><p>
Where does the food we eat come from?
</p><p>
We get most of it from plants. Wheat, corn, peas, and beans are
seeds of plants. Almost all our bread is made from wheat. Beets,
turnips, and radishes are roots of plants. Lettuce and cabbage are
the leaves of plants.
</p>

<p>Apples, peaches, pears, and other fruits grow on plants. All these
we use for food.
</p><p>
Plants also supply us with material for clothing. Some clothes are
made from cotton; cotton grows in the pod of a plant. Some clothes
are made from linen; linen comes from flax, which is a plant. Hats
are made from straw; straw is the stem or stalk of plants.
</p><p>
Now, these plants, which supply us with so much of our food and
clothing, do not grow of themselves.
</p><p>
The ground must be plowed, the seeds planted and taken care of
while growing. So, outside the city, you may see a great many
people at work raising grain, vegetables, and other plants. This
occupation we call <i>agriculture</i> or <i>farming;</i> the people
we call farmers.

<p>Animals, as well as plants, furnish much of our food. All meat
comes from animals. We get milk from cows. From milk we make butter
and cheese.
</p><p>
Animals also supply us with clothing. Many articles of dress are
made of wool. Wool, you know, grows on the sheep. Shoes and kid
gloves are made of leather. Leather is made from the hides of cows;
sheep, oxen, and goats.
</p><p>
But animals could not live and grow if people did not carefully
raise them. In the country, yon may see flocks of sheep and herds
of cows and oxen feeding on the fresh sweet grass of the pastures.
Those animals are called stock. The business of those who raise
them is called <i>stock-raising.</i>
</p><p>
Most farmers raise cows, horses, and other animals. Which land does
the farmer use for pasture? What is a pasture? What is a
meadow?
</p><p>
Grazing means feeding on grass. What animals have you seen grazing?
Does a dog graze? A cow?
</p><p>
Mountains, so rough and rocky, are not good for farms and gardens.
But many of them contain coal, on which millions of people depend
for heat and light. In mountains, too, we find iron, which is more
useful to us than gold and silver.

"A MINE IS LIKE A GREAT CAVERN." border="0" align="right" /></a> To
get these, thousands of men are at work in places called mines. A
mine is like a great cavern. There is neither sun nor sky. Torches
and lamps give the only light the miners have to see by. The air is
damp and close. I suppose you would not like to work in such a
place. Yet great numbers of persons are employed in
<i>mining.</i>
</p><p>
How is coal taken out of a mine? What are the dangers of
coal-mining? Try to find answers to these questions for yourself.
If necessary, your teacher will help you.
</p><p>
In some parts of the country are forests of pine, oak, and other
trees. Some of these forests are so large we might travel for days
or weeks through them. From trees we get lumber. Lumber is needed
for building houses and ships, and for furniture. So a great many
men are employed in cutting down trees and preparing the wood for
use. This is called <i>lumbering</i>.
</p><p>
The lumbermen go into the woods in winter, and build themselves
little huts to live in. All through the winter months they work in
the woods from sunrise to sunset, felling the best trees and
cutting them into logs. Then they haul them over the snow-covered
ground to the frozen streams, and pile them upon the banks.

snow and ice have melted and the streams are full. Then they are
floated down to the great saw-mills; and cut up into boards, laths,
shingles, and other kinds of lumber.

<p>The sea yields much that we eat. Some parts abound in codfish,
mackerel, and herring. Sardines, the little fish that come in
boxes, are also found in the sea. It is the business of thousands

pack them, to send to those who want them for food.

In the city or town we shall find many of the people busy about
something else than the occupations we have learned. What do you
suppose it is?
</p><p>
If you go about the city, you will see large buildings several
stories high, with long rows of windows, and great smoking
chimneys. These are mills or factories, full of machines in motion
doing their work almost like human beings.
</p><p>
The people who work in them make almost everything that is needed
for our use. Wheat is changed into flour; cotton, into thread, fine
muslins, and pretty calicoes; leather, into boots and shoes; iron
and steel, into plows, stoves; and cutlery; lumber, into wagons,
carriages, and all kinds of furniture. Other articles which we must
not forget are elegant jewelry, all sorts of ornaments for parlors,
and beautiful toys which you admire so much.

<p>It would take a long time to name a small part of the things made
in the busy mills and factories; but think of the articles used in
your home, and you may be sure they are manufactured articles. You
see, <i>manufacturing</i> gives work to many thousands of
persons.
</p><p>
What is cutlery? Name some articles of cutlery.
</p><p>
We need many things which we do not produce. Other people need
things which they do not produce. How can each obtain what he
needs? By exchanging one thing for another. This exchange of goods,
or buying and selling them for money; gives rise to another
occupation called <i>trade</i>, or <i>commerce</i>. So many people
spend their time buying and selling grain, vegetables, clothing,
boots and shoes, or in sending them to places where they are
needed.
</p><p>
On all the large rivers and lakes you may see boats going up and
down, carrying goods from one part of the country to another.
</p><p>
Can you think how goods are carried from place to place where there
are no rivers? In countries where few people live, goods are often
carried in wagons and on the backs of animals.
</p><p>
I wonder how many people have to work to get food and clothing for
us. Make a list of all the occupations you can think of. Perhaps
you can think of other occupations we have not named. Is
dressmaking an occupation? Teaching? Which occupation would you
prefer? Why?
</p><p>
If you think, perhaps you can tell why men do different kinds of
work. What people do to make a living, depends very much upon the
place they live in. For men almost always do that kind of work that
pays them best for their labor.
</p><p>
Those who live where the land is rich and level will raise grain to
make flour, or cotton and flax to make clothing. Some people among
the mountains work in the mines. Some keep cows for their milk and
butter, and sheep for their wool; for the hills and many of the
mountain sides afford excellent pasture. People who live near the
sea will be apt to catch fish along the coast, or engage in trade
upon the water.
</p><p>
Employments in the city differ widely from those in the country.
Here, as we have learned, most people make their living by working
in factories, or as merchants in buying and selling goods which
come from all parts of the world.
</p><p>
All people do not live in the same way. Some people have no
churches, schools, books, or factories.

all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
